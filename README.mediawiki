If you wish to submit a PIP, having initial discussions on the Pegnet discord with the core developers and community is recommended. Pips with support are more likely to be fast-tracked into implementation.

The PIP process is loosely defined, so although the process will aid development decisions, it does not mean that all development must strictly follow the pip process. To ensure your PIP is implemented, providing the pull request to the reference code would greatly assist the chance of getting accepted into the source code. If a PIP is formally accepted as a standard or by the codebase, the status should be either be `Active` or `Final`. Once a PIP reaches this status, the only way to change the PIP is with another.

It should be known without consensus from the miners and users of the protocol, a PIP cannot be enforced. In the end, it is the users of the protocol that must adopt and accept the final implementation.
